## Introduction 1

## Introduction 2: MSE




## Aims

In this presentation, I aim to to do a couple of different things. First, I will introduce GMSE, or Generalised MSE,
which my colleagues have developed as an R package. I will provide a brief overview of its purpose, the methods it uses,
and how it may be used. 
Second, I will demonstrate GMSE's capabilities by exploring the effect of variation in stakeholders - particulary in
terms of wealth and land ownership - on the management of harvested populations.
Specifically, by doing the latter, I will show how GMSE can be used flexibly to understand mechanisms of conservation
management where other management models are perhaps too simplistic or inflexible.
