## 1. Title

Hello everyone and thank you very much for the opportunity to present this work. What I will be talking about here is
part of the work that is ongoing in the ConFooBio group at Stirling University. I should stress that the results I'll be
presenting are still very much a work in progress, and that this is very much a collaborative project - in particular, I
should make mention of Brad Duthie who has been responsible for the development of the modelling platform I am using
here.

## 2. Introduction (1)

It should be no news to anyone in this room that with rapidly increasing world populations - the image here on the left
is from the recent Living Planet Index report - anthropogenic pressures on the planet are also increasing rapidly. In
particular, exploitation of natural resources is a significantly component of this. This could of course take the form
of extraction of resources such as timber, it also includes concurrent growth demand for food production through
agriculture, harvesting of animal populations, and also control of animal populations that may hinder crop productions.
In other words, the extent of conflicts between human interest in natural resources, and the conservation of animal
populations is growing.

## 3. Introduction (2)

As a consequence of such conflicts, the need for, and interest in, effective management of socio-economic systems has
increased in recent years. Management strategy evaluation approaches, which consist of conceptual frameworks for
management of systems in which stakeholders - both resource users and managers - interact with natural resources,
provide a toolbox for such management. I don't intend to go into much detail about these in general here, but suffice to
say that they have their origins in fisheries management, where resource populations (such as fish stocks) are observed
through monitoring; these observations are then used by a manager to set certain harvesting limits (for example a
harvest control rule). These rules in turn affect how users (for example fishers) exploit the resource populations,
which feeds back into new observations.
In recent years, attempts have been made to apply such MSE approaches to non-fisheries systems, such as terrestrial
herbivores.

## 4. Introduction (3)

However, what almost all existing modelling frameworks for such socio-economic systems are lacking, are easy ways to
take account of, and include variability among stakeholders. This is obviously important on many different spatial
scales - individual farmers or farms for example often have highly variable financial means - propery sizes, budgets, or
even extent of possible farming activities will vary. Although it is intuitively clear that such variation will affect
the extent to which such stakeholders affect natural resources, most implementations of MSE cannot account for this.

## 5. Introduction (4)

This is potentially an important shortcoming, because from previous studies we know that socio-political variation can
affect biodiversity conservation.
On a global level, for example, these two different studies by Holland et al and Mikkelson et al. both show the effect
of country-level differences in measures of economic inequality (here measured as the Gini-index) on species threat
status. Specifically, as economic inequality increases, both analyses suggest that a greater number of species are at
greater risk of extinctions.
Thus, it is clear that effect socio-ecological management frameworks need to be able to account for variation in
inequality among stakeholders.

## 6. Aims

So, that brings me to the aims of the current talk.
They are two-fold.
First, I intend to introduce GMSE, or Generalise MSE. This is a highly flexible and extensible modelling framework for MSE, which was developed over the last few years in the ConFooBio group at Stirling University. Although I unfortunately will not nearly have enough time here to introduce all of the detail of GMSE, I will give a very quick overview of its methodologies and potential.
As a practical demonstration of this, I will then briefly use GMSE to briefly explore the effect of economic inequality on the management of an exploited populatiion. This is still very much a work in progress and is not intended as a final answer, but it will hopefully provide you with a good impression of the power and flexibility of GMSE as a tool.

## 7. GMSE (1)

So, GMSE - as said, this is a specific implementation of a MSE framework. As such, it follows the rough outline we have
already seen, and consists of four main component models. The natural resource is modelled, which is observed through an
observation model, feeds into a manager model, and then into a user model. Users' decision affect the resource, after
which the cycle starts again.
In GMSE, each of these four models are entirely customisable, but by default they are individually-based and spatially explicit. 
In the default set up, it is easiest to conceptualise as users being farmers which aim to maximise yield from their
crop, and  the manager being a government setting a target resource population which they are trying to maintain. The
resource population would be animals which can damage crop yield.
Actions taken by users may or may not affect the resource population - examples are farming, killing resources or
scaring resources (which moves the resource away from a farmers' land).
In each time step, costs for each of these actions are set by the manager as a function of both their budget, and the
distance between the current population level and the target.
In turn, users choose their action based on their likely effect on yield and their cost. 

As said, I don't have time to go into much detail here, but GMSE is available as an R package with extensive documentation, including many examples.

## 8. Simualtion scenarios

Instead, what I will do here, is provide you with a specific example of using GMSE to explore the effect of variation among stakeholders.
As a general set up, with mostly use the default GMSE setup, but specifically simulating a resource population undermanagement, which negatively affects crop yield. 
Possible user actions are limited to farming, killing resources or scaring resources off their land.
It is important to note that such user actions can only affect resources on their own land - they can't kill on land owned by others. 
Here, I have simulated a sample of 8 users.

In addition to this basic GMSE set up, I have here introduced variation among stakeholders in terms of both budget and yield.
Specifically, the users' budget in each time step is a function of the yield they achieve; for simplicity, here I has implemented this as a simple linear function with a little bit of variation around it.
In addition to this, I vary land distribution in four different scenarios - one following the default GMSE land distribution, where each user simply has an equal share of the landscape, and three where the land distribution is increasingly uneven - from 25% of the landscape belonging to a single user, to 50% to 75%.
This variation in land ownership will obviously have consequences for both potential yield, but also potential effect on the resource population.



4. At same time, much recent evidence that social equality has important repurcussions for conservation success, but
current modelling approaches have not explored this to a great extent.

5. Aims: (1) introduce GMSE as flexible and extensible platform for MSE, (2) show how this can be used to explore
effects of stakeholder variability (here: wealth and land ownership) on population management.

6. GMSE overview: model outline, individual-based, spatially explicit.

7. GMSE overview: manager and user decision making: genetic algorithm

8. GMSE overview: default set up. Users are farmers, resource is population that has negative effect on crops. Users can
choose to farm, shoot resources or scare resources. Resources redistribute over landscape. Users aim to maximise yield,
manager aims to minimise population distance to target. Typical output. Note here stakeholders (users) do not vary -
equal budgets and equal land ownership.
What happens when this varies?

9. Exploring the effect of inequality on conservation management 1
Scenario outline: as default GMSE, but - 
- 8 stakeholders (farmers)
- User budgets are a function of farming yield in previous time step
- Landscape ownership varied: either equally distributed (as default), or % of landscape owned by single farmer.

## 1. Introduction 1

With increasing human populations worldwide, pressures on ecosystems and ecosystem services are growing rapidly. As a
consequence, situations of conflict between human interests and conservation of habitats or animal populations are
becoming more and more commonplace.
Typically, such conservation conflicts can involve 

[Increasing human pops; increasing conflicts, increasing need for evidence-based management of populations ]

## 3. Aims

In this presentation, I aim to to do a couple of different things. First, I will introduce GMSE, or Generalised MSE,
which my colleagues have developed as an R package. I will provide a brief overview of its purpose, the methods it uses,
and how it may be used. 
Second, I will demonstrate GMSE's capabilities by exploring the effect of variation in stakeholders - particulary in
terms of wealth and land ownership - on the management of harvested populations.
Specifically, by doing the latter, I will show how GMSE can be used flexibly to understand mechanisms of conservation
management where other management models are perhaps too simplistic or inflexible.
