1. Increasing human pops; increasing conflicts, increasing need for evidence-based management of populations

2. MSE models provide promising tool for helping with such management

3. However, most MSE frameworks limiting in ability to account for variation in stakeholders - in particularly decision
making processes but also in terms of stakeholder properties

4. At same time, much recent evidence that social equality has important repurcussions for conservation success, but
current modelling approaches have not explored this to a great extent.

5. Aims: (1) introduce GMSE as flexible and extensible platform for MSE, (2) show how this can be used to explore
effects of stakeholder variability (here: wealth and land ownership) on population management.

6. GMSE overview: model outline, individual-based, spatially explicit.

7. GMSE overview: manager and user decision making: genetic algorithm

8. GMSE overview: default set up. Users are farmers, resource is population that has negative effect on crops. Users can
choose to farm, shoot resources or scare resources. Resources redistribute over landscape. Users aim to maximise yield,
manager aims to minimise population distance to target. Typical output. Note here stakeholders (users) do not vary -
equal budgets and equal land ownership.
What happens when this varies?

9. Exploring the effect of inequality on conservation management 1
Scenario outline: as default GMSE, but - 
- 8 stakeholders (farmers)
- User budgets are a function of farming yield in previous time step
- Landscape ownership varied: either equally distributed (as default), or % of landscape owned by single farmer.

## 1. Introduction 1

With increasing human populations worldwide, pressures on ecosystems and ecosystem services are growing rapidly. As a
consequence, situations of conflict between human interests and conservation of habitats or animal populations are
becoming more and more commonplace.
Typically, such conservation conflicts can involve

## 3. Aims

In this presentation, I aim to to do a couple of different things. First, I will introduce GMSE, or Generalised MSE,
which my colleagues have developed as an R package. I will provide a brief overview of its purpose, the methods it uses,
and how it may be used. 
Second, I will demonstrate GMSE's capabilities by exploring the effect of variation in stakeholders - particulary in
terms of wealth and land ownership - on the management of harvested populations.
Specifically, by doing the latter, I will show how GMSE can be used flexibly to understand mechanisms of conservation
management where other management models are perhaps too simplistic or inflexible.
